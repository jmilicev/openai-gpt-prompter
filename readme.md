Certainly! Here's an example of a `README.md` file for the `toolkit.js` script:

# OpenAI Toolkit

This toolkit provides a command-line interface (CLI) for interacting with OpenAI's GPT models. It allows you to generate text based on prompts using the OpenAI API.

## Prerequisites

Before using this toolkit, make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js 
- NPM (Node Package Manager)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the `toolkit.js` script to your local machine.

2. Install the required dependencies by running the following command in the project directory:

   ```shell
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the project directory and add your OpenAI API key as follows:

   ```plaintext
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

## Usage

To use the toolkit, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.

2. Run the following command to start the CLI prompt:

   ```shell
   node toolkit.js
   ```

3. You will be prompted to enter a prompt for GPT. Type your prompt and press Enter.

4. The generated text will be displayed in the console.

   - If you want to exit the program, type 'exit' and press Enter.
   - If you want to edit the settings, type 'config' and press Enter. You can modify the temperature, max_tokens, and model type.

## Configuration

The toolkit provides options to configure the following settings:

- Temperature: Controls the randomness of the generated text. A higher value (e.g., 0.8) produces more random outputs, while a lower value (e.g., 0.2) produces more deterministic outputs.

- Max Tokens: Limits the length of the generated text. You can set the maximum number of tokens the model should generate.

- Model Type: Specifies the GPT model to use. The default is "gpt-3.5-turbo", which is the most advanced model as of the last update.

To edit the settings, type 'config' when prompted for a new input and follow the instructions.
